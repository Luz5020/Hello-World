# Hello-World
It starts here

I can say that this Version (Indev 01) won't contain anything Noteworthy yet, but rather serve as a Setup version

Indev02 will contain the first of many Files actually containing something, somewhat containing code...

Some explanation, currently each Indev version will resemble one Day or Session of coding, pushing commits from an IDE makes the commits in Github be very compact, so Branching for each Day of Work is implemented for the current worklfow, changes will be announced (als ReadMe is currently a noticeboard)
